IFL 2017 - CALL FOR PAPERS
==========================

29th SYMPOSIUM ON IMPLEMENTATION AND APPLICATION OF FUNCTIONAL LANGUAGES
========================================================================

University of Bristol, UK

In cooperation with ACM SIGPLAN

Wednesday 30 August - Friday 1 September, 2017

http://iflconference.org/

Scope
-----

The goal of the IFL symposia is to bring together researchers actively engaged
in the implementation and application of functional and function-based
programming languages. IFL 2017 will be a venue for researchers to present and
discuss new ideas and concepts, work in progress, and publication-ripe results
related to the implementation and application of functional languages and
function-based programming.

Peer-review
-----------

Following the IFL tradition, IFL 2017 will use a post-symposium review process
to produce the formal proceedings. All participants of IFL 2017 are invited to
submit either a draft paper or an extended abstract describing work to be
presented at the symposium. At no time may work submitted to IFL be
simultaneously submitted to other venues; submissions must adhere to ACM
SIGPLAN's republication policy:

http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication

The submissions will be screened by the program committee chair to make sure
they are within the scope of IFL, and will appear in the draft proceedings
distributed at the symposium. Submissions appearing in the draft proceedings
are not peer-reviewed publications. Hence, publications that appear only in the
draft proceedings are not subject to the ACM SIGPLAN republication policy.
After the symposium, authors will be given the opportunity to incorporate the
feedback from discussions at the symposium and will be invited to submit a
revised full article for the formal review process. From the revised
submissions, the program committee will select papers for the formal
proceedings considering their correctness, novelty, originality, relevance,
significance, and clarity. The formal proceedings will appear in the
International Conference Proceedings Series of the ACM Digital Library.

Submission details
------------------

Prospective authors are encouraged to submit papers or extended abstracts to be
published in the draft proceedings and to present them at the symposium. All
contributions must be written in English. Papers must use the new ACM two
columns conference format, which can be found at:

http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template

For the pre-symposium proceedings we adopt a 'weak' page limit of 12 pages. For
the post-symposium proceedings the page limit of 12 pages is firm.

Authors submit through EasyChair:

- array processing
- concurrent/parallel programming
- concurrent/parallel program execution
- embedded systems
- web applications
- (embedded) domain specific languages
- security
- novel memory management techniques
- run-time profiling performance measurements
- debugging and tracing
- virtual/abstract machine architectures

Peter Landin Prize
------------------

The Peter Landin Prize is awarded to the best paper presented at the symposium
every year. The honored article is selected by the program committee based on
the submissions received for the formal review process. The prize carries a
cash award equivalent to 150 Euros.
